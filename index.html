            <h2 id="Site1.0">Dipping my toes into Web Development with the creation of this Site 1.0</h2>
            <P class="Date"> <sup>3<sup class="Suptext">rd</sup> January 2021</sup></P>
            <p> 
                As soon as I realised I might end up creating a website, I started taking note of what I was
                doing. Initially, inspiration wasn’t web development per se, however my desire to learn
                JavaScript led to me dipping my toes into the WebDev world and here we are. Hooray... Since
                everything’s recorded and I have further plans for this site and my skills as a developer,
                writing up how I got here could prove valuable in the future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">Odin Project</a> and it was from here I started learning the basics of HTML &amp;
                    CSS (literally all I know is basics right now) with the best secondary resources as discovered
                    through the Odin project, being <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/"target="_blank">Shayhowe.com</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Web Docs</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I reached the task of recreating the Google homepage as part of the Odin Project, I
decided to opt for something where I could display more of my own creative flair with the
new skills I had learnt. And since I have plans to write articles anyway, having recently
written ‘Addressing the Why for Bitcoin’ I thought a blog would do nicely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking forward, as I intended this to be a Website I would in fact use, I didn’t like the idea
of having to edit the code every time I wanted to publish a new article. I don’t hardcode
tweets onto twitter; I log in, there’s a nice little section for tweeting and then I go spew
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/NicoUndefined/status/1345974143490154501" target="_blank"> foolishness</a>. Here I realised a CMS or content management system might be better for my
needs. Something like WordPress. However, since that would defeat the purpose of my
Web-Development project I decided to go along with the process only marginally jaded.
Focusing on styling and a framework for which more could be added.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with style I first wanted to create a dark website, black background white text.
However, the large majority of the Blogs I looked at for inspiration, the ones I read, were all
white and I wondered if there was any true benefit. And unsurprisingly <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/dark-ui" target="_blank">Dark UI isn’t the best
choice when it comes to Blog-type content</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Having lost more than half of my brand identity I started thinking about the design of my
blog and as I had learnt online decided to sketch it out on paper first. The name Un_Defined
came to me by way of divine intervention, as a perfect fit to replace my placeholder/typo of
UNdecided in my HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it came to fleshing out the page two YouTube videos were particularly helpful. My
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLgtucwjVII&amp%3Bt=123s" target="_blank">Nav-Bar</a> Master in addition to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA" target="_blank">responsive CSS Grid</a> God were my two angels, for without
them entering my life, I may well have regressed and created a mock-up Google Homepage
instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the site was fully marked up and the styling had been added I looked for ways to
publish it. Through Mozilla Web Docs I learnt that you could actually do this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrJ4oN1u_8" target="_blank"> through GitHub</a>,
which would be a perfect fit since I could populate my empty GitHub in the absence of a
Google Homepage replica.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you publish through GitHub pages your website must be static rather than dynamic.
In looking at the <a href="https://www.fasthosts.co.uk/blog/static-vs-dynamic-websites/" target="_blank">differences between Static and Dynamic</a>  websites I began to see the power
in Html and CSS and why writing it off for the use of CMS can only stem from ignorance.
Further plans for this site actually include developing it into the latter to add more
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wFJj94kSTU" target="_blank">functionality and depth</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this stage I wanted my own domain name rather than the bulky domain name as offered
                by GitHub. Seeing that you could <a href="http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/" target="_blank"> add your own domain name to your GitHub</a> hosted
                website was great and I eventually did this, not through google domains, but through the
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CpCgqUf94k&amp%3Bt=618s" target="_blank">first</a> few YouTube results’ favourite in <a href="https://www.dynadot.com/" target="_blank"> Dynadot</a>. ‘undefined.london’ was a nice find and was
                a good enough price in my opinion. ‘.com’ and the other favourites were taken but this
                works perfectly for now.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I was practically finished here, however I started to question the negatives to hosting with
GitHub; It seemed too good of a deal. In learning about some of the <a href="https://kevinsweet.com/pros-cons-github-pages" target="_blank"> downsides of control</a>,
speed, security, I realised they weren’t particularly impactful to me right now. The next
iteration of this site would solve these perhaps as I move off of GitHub and to a paid host.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of, the 1.0 in the title is in no way meaningless I have full intention of adding to
and quite dramatically changing the way this site operates and furthermore, writing about
it. I will use this site and my desire to upgrade it, not only as incentive in becoming a full
stack developer but also as a vessel for the many ideas that require its growth from a static
Web blog hosted by GitHub to whatever mutation I’ve fathered in at 9.0.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next on The Odin Project for me: Rock, Paper, Scissors in JavaScript. Hooray...
